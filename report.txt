Project 4 Report:

StreetMap:

Load() : Lets say the file that Load opens and reads from has N lines,
additionally average case of searching and associating is O(1) in the HashTable.
The functions is O(N).
  
getSegmentsThatStartWith(): Since this function calls the find Hash Table function 
as its primary action, this function shares its average base case which is O(1).

PointToPointRouter: 

generatePointToPointRoute(): This algorithm is based off a DFS search, therefore we can
let N be the number of GeoCoords mapped to vectors, where each vector has an average of A 
street segments. Since I sort each vector found the time complexity of this function will be
O((N+E)E^2) = O(N*E^2+E^3). (Note: E is going to be always way smaller than N, realistically
this is still on average O(N))

DeliveryOptimizer:

optimizeDeliveryOrder(): Let the deliveries vector have an average of N deliveryRequests,
the time complexity for this function will be O(N^2).
